# Project with ADS-B flight data 
[adsbexchange.com](http://www.adsbexchange.com) is a website the aggregates data from people all over the world who record unencrypted information being beamed out of airplanes all the time.

>[ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast) stands for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. It’s a dreadful name that only an engineer could love, but it happens to be fairly descriptive. Let’s look at each part of it:
>
> * *Automatic–* properly-equipped aircraft automatically report their position, without need for a radar interrogation
> * *Dependent–* ADS-B depends on aircraft having an approved WAAS GPS on board and an ADS-B Out transmitter
> * *Surveillance–* it is a surveillance technology that allows ATC to watch airplanes move around
> * *Broadcast–* aircraft broadcast their position information to airplanes and ATC
>
>This system doesn’t need radar to work properly, but it will depend on a network of ground stations to receive aircraft reports and send them back to ATC. These stations also transmit weather and traffic information back up to properly-equipped aircraft. This network currently consists of over 400 stations, and the complete network is supposed to be finished by early 2014. So when you hear that ADS-B moves from a “ground-based” radar system to a “satellite-based” system, it’s only partially true.

A more technical description of  how the ADS-B standard encodes signals into 112 bits is given [here](http://adsb-decode-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/airborne-velocity.html).

# Download data and load into R
## download
[Download json data as a zipped file](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=310&DB_Short_Name=Air%20Carriers) and extract to a folder called `extracted_data`.
The [adsbexchange pageabout data](https://www.adsbexchange.com/data/) has the following to say about archived data-

>Essentially, this is a JSON of all aircraft, with “short trails” activated. The short trail duration used in the historical data archive is 65 seconds.  This gives all the current information on the aircraft, plus any known positions, altitudes and timestamps for the previous 65 seconds.  Since this query is issued every 60 seconds, all known positions should be captured in the data. Please consult this page for an explanation of data field contents.
>
>This file is captured every 60 seconds, typically on the 30-second mark of any given minute. This generates 1,440 files daily, which then get zipped into a single archive per day.  The archive for the previous day is typically available by 0100Z (01:00 UTC) the following day. Data is available beginning on June 9, 2016. Daily files are currently in the neighborhood of 7.9 GB each. Transfer rates may be somewhat limited depending on the latency of your connection.

## load into R 
The data was loaded into R using the following R code from ankhi- 
```{r}
library(jsonlite)
json_file <- (file="/home/debanjan/forAnkhi/extracted_data/2016-06-20-0000Z.json")
json_data <- jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = json_file,simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)
json_data<-json_data$acList
```
##load all files in a loop into a single dataframe
Obtained [recipe from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14958516/looping-through-all-files-in-directory-in-r-applying-multiple-commands)

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
#create list of files
files <- list.files(path="/home/debanjan/forAnkhi/extracted_data/",
                    pattern="*Z.json",
                    full.names=T,
                    recursive=FALSE)
#create empty json_dataframe
json_df<-NULL
#loop over first 10 files and save data to dataframe 
files_to_loop<-files[1:10]
for (i in 1:length(files_to_loop)){
  x<-files[i]
  json_data_dummy<-jsonlite::fromJSON(txt =x ,simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)$acList
  json_df<-rbind(json_df,json_data_dummy)
  print(x)
}
json_data<-json_df
```

## code for plotting histogram using ggplot
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot_histogram_categorical<-function(x,angle=90){
 x.hist<- table(x)
 x.hist.df<-as.data.frame(x.hist)
 return(ggplot(data = x.hist.df, aes(x=x.hist.df$x,y=x.hist.df$Freq))+

# Data Exploration 
## Interesting fields
Explanations for what the fields contain is obtained from the [adsbexchange website](https://www.adsbexchange.com/datafields/)

#### Rcvr(integer) 
 
 “Receiver ID number”. Prior to April 27, 2017, this was always “1”.  After that, it is a unique ID referring to which specific receiver logged the data. Receiver number is 5 to 7 digit integer, with the format of “RRRYXXX”.  
  Brief explanation below:
  
* RRR – Receiving server.  Could be from 1 – 3 digits.
    + Servers 1-7 are servers that receive load-balanced incoming connections, either in VRS or Beast/RAW format.  Incoming feeds are dynamically assigned to one of these servers, and the receiver ID “XXX” is also dynamically assigned.
    + Server 100 is the “Custom Feed” server, where feeders can send to a specific port and always get the same feeder ID.  
*  Y – Type of feed.
    + 1 = Beast/RAW
    + 3 = Compressed VRS
    + 5 = Satellite/Inmarsat/JAERO
    + 6 = Aggregated from a group of receivers
* XXX – a unique number assigned to feeds.  Static on server 100.  Dynamic on other servers.

##### Investigation and Results
Since the data belongs to before April 17, 2017,we expect all the values to be 1
```{r}
array1<-json_data$Rcvr
print(unique(array1))
print(array1[1:10])
```
    
####HasSig (boolean) 
True if the aircraft has a signal level associated with it. The level will be included in the “Sig” field.
#####Investigation and Results
Are there any aircrafts with no signals associated?
```{r}
array1<-json_data$HasSig
table(array1)
```
 Why is that? -> receiver-dependent. 
 
 <span style="color:red">OPEN</span>Is it a good measure of plane-to-receiver distance?

####Sig (number)
The signal level for the last message received from the aircraft, as reported by the receiver. Not all receivers pass signal levels. The value’s units are receiver-dependent.

#####Investigation and Results
```{r}
array1<-json_data$Sig
array2<-json_data$HasSig
signals<-array1[array2]
sig.hist.plot<-qplot(signals,geom='histogram')+stat_bin(bins = 50)
sig.hist.plot
```
The distribution falls off exponentially. It makes sense that there would be less readings with the strongest signal strength because the angular spped of the plane are highest when they are at the disntance of minimum approach from the receiver.  
Also the supposed kink at the end can mean that there is some variation between the power of the signal based on manufacturer of the planes?  
<span style="color:red">OPEN</span> Can this distribution be simulated using a model?


<span style="color:red">OPEN</span> Should be interesting to compare signal strength to plane-to-receiver distance.

####Icao (six-digit hex)
One of the most important fields. This is the six-digit hexadecimal identifier broadcast by the aircraft over the air in order to identify itself.  Blocks of these codes are assigned to countries by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  Each country then assigns individual codes to aircraft registered in that country. There should generally be a one to one correlation between an aircraft registration number and ICAO hex code.  The ICAO hex identifier can be used to lookup information such as aircraft registration, type, owner/operator, etc in various databases around the internet such as [airframes.org](http://www.airframes.org). It should be noted that generally the ICAO hex code remains the same as long as the aircraft’s “Registration number” remains the same. If the registration number changes, which can happen sometimes when an aircraft is sold to an owner in another country, the ICAO hex code will also change.

#####Investigation and Results
How many times are signals from the same plane intercepted in a day?
```{r}
array1<-json_data$Icao
array2<-table(array1)

sprintf("Out of %d adsb-readings %d unique planes were found",length(array1),length(array2))
```
We expect roughly similar number of readings per plane?
```{r}
icao.hist.plot<-plot_histogram_categorical(array1)
icao.hist.plot
```
<span style="color:red">OPEN </span>Number of readings inversely correlated to speed of plane?

####Reg (alphanumeric)
Aircraft registration number.  This is looked up via a database based on the ICAO code.  This information is only as good as the database, and is not pulled off the airwaves. It is not broadcast by the aircraft.  
<span style="color:green">CLOSED </span> Not interesting

####Fseen (datetime – epoch format) 
date and time the receiver first started seeing the aircraft on this flight.  Accurate for a single receiver, but as the plane is detected by different receivers, this will change.  
<span style="color:red">OPEN </span>Might be interesting when combined with other data.

####Tsecs (integer)
The number of seconds that the aircraft has been tracked for.  Will change as aircraft roams between receiving servers.

#####Investigation and Results
<span style="color:red">OPEN </span>Regression with number of readings must be very linear?? Or is it impossible to separate out data between different recievers?

```{r}
array_counts<-cbind(json_data$Icao,json_data$TSecs)
```
####Cmsgs (integer)
The count of messages received for the aircraft.  Will change as aircraft roams between receiving servers.
```{r}
array_counts<-cbind(array_counts,json_data$CMsgs)
```
 
####Alt (integer)
The altitude in feet at standard pressure. (broadcast by the aircraft)

#####Investigation and Results
<span style="color:red">OPEN </span>The geometric altitude can be calculated and used in the modelling of the signal strength histogram.

####Galt (integer) 
The altitude adjusted for local air pressure, should be roughly the height above mean sea level.

####Investigation and Results
We should see a lot of clustering at different cruising altitudes, and some in between for the ones in transition between two levels. 
```{r}
array1<-json_data$Alt
no.of.na<-sum(is.na(array1))
sprintf("there are %d missing GAlt values out of a total of %d records",no.of.na,length(array1))
galt.hist.plot<-qplot(array1,geom='histogram',na.rm = TRUE,
                      #breaks = c(0:100)*500)
                      breaks = c(0:1900)*25)
#galt.hist.plot<-plot_histogram_categorical(array1)
galt.hist.plot
```


####InHG (float)
The air pressure in inches of mercury that was used to calculate the AMSL altitude from the standard pressure altitude.

####AltT (boolean)
The type of altitude transmitted by the aircraft: 0 = standard pressure altitude, 1 = indicated altitude (above mean sea level). Default to standard pressure altitude until told otherwise.

####Lat (float)
The aircraft’s latitude over the ground.

####Long (float) 
The aircraft’s longitude over the ground.
<span style="color:red">OPEN </span>Plot trails on a map/GIS

#####Investigation and Results
Information on how to plot points on maps was obtained from [this stackoverflow page](http://www.milanor.net/blog/maps-in-r-plotting-data-points-on-a-map/).    
More about ggmap can be found [here](http://stat405.had.co.nz/ggmap.pdf).  
A nice ggmap cheatsheet can be found [here](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/ggmap/ggmapCheatsheet.pdf).
```{r}
pos<-data.frame(lat=json_data$Lat,lon=json_data$Long)
library(ggmap)
map <- get_map(location = 'New York', zoom = 7)
mapPoints <- ggmap(map) +
   geom_point(aes(x = pos$lon, y = pos$lat), data =pos , alpha = .5,size=0.01)
mapPoints

```

####PosTime (epoch milliseconds) 
The time (at UTC in JavaScript ticks, UNIX epoch format in milliseconds) that the position was last reported by the aircraft. This field is the time at which the aircraft was at the lat/long/altitude reported above. https://www.epochconverter.com/ may be helpful.

####Mlat (boolean) 
True if the latitude and longitude appear to have been calculated by an MLAT (multilateration) server and were not transmitted by the aircraft. Multilateration is based on the time difference that specific receivers detect the signal and a mathematical calculation.  It is significantly less accurate than ADS-B, which is based on GPS, and more likely to result in jagged aircraft tracks. Aircraft that have Mode S (and have not upgraded to ADS-B) can sometimes be tracked via multilateration.  It requires 3-4 ground stations in different locations to be receiving the aircraft signal simultaneously in order to allow the calculation.

 + Route database -  
 As of January 2012, the OpenFlights/Airline Route Mapper Route Database contains 59036 routes between 3209 airports on 531 airlines spanning the globe, as shown in the map above. Each entry contains the following information:  
  1. **Airline** 	2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.  
  2. **Airline ID** 	Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline (see Airline).
  3. **Source airport** 	3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.
  4. **Source airport ID** 	Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport (see Airport)
  5. **Destination airport** 	3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination airport.
  6. **Destination airport ID** 	Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport (see Airport)
  7. **Codeshare** 	"Y" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline, but another carrier), empty otherwise.
  8. **Stops** 	Number of stops on this flight ("0" for direct)
  9. **Equipment** 	3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight, separated by spaces
  
* The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.  
**Notes**:   
Routes are directional: if an airline operates services from A to B and from B to A, both A-B and B-A are listed separately.  
Routes where one carrier operates both its own and codeshare flights are listed only once.   
**Sample entries**  
BA,1355,SIN,3316,LHR,507,,0,744 777  
BA,1355,SIN,3316,MEL,3339,Y,0,744  
TOM,5013,ACE,1055,BFS,465,,0,320
